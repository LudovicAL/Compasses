# Compasses
This minigame demonstrate 4 different compasses for video games:

- A standard compass
- A compressed compass that uses a shader
- A top and bottom compass
- An all around the screen compass that uses a custom mesh

All of these compasses are made with the same starting texture:

An online version of the game can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/Compasses/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
